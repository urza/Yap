## Run with Docker

```bash
docker run -d --name yap -p 5221:8080 -v ./uploads:/app/wwwroot/uploads -v ./data:/app/Data ghcr.io/urza/yap:latest
```

There are two volumes:
- "uploads" which holds media (pictures) uploaded by users
- "data" which contains configuration (appsettings.json), SQLite db (if enabled), and custom emojis

Access at `http://localhost:5221` - it's up to you how to make this accessible for others. For example use some reverse proxy like nginx proxy manager  (https://nginxproxymanager.com/) or cloudflare tunnel.
