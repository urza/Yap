/// The actual playable URLs are looked up at render time via the GifService by GifEntryId — this
/// lets background normalization (provider CDN URL → local file, MP4 → WebM transcode) update what
/// gets served without rewriting historical messages.

/// A record with init-only properties: ChatDbContext compares GifAttachments element-wise to
/// detect changes, so an attachment must be equal by value and must not change in place.
