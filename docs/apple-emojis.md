# Emoji Rendering (Apple ⇄ Twemoji)

Documentation for the emoji-image feature. Audience: future maintainers (you and Claude).

## TL;DR

Yap renders **emoji as images for everyone** by reusing the existing unicode → `<img>` pipeline. A
single **code-only `const`** (`ActiveEmojiStyle`) flips the active set between **Apple**
(`emoji-datasource-apple` PNGs) and **Twemoji** (SVGs). Self-hosted overrides always win in both
modes. There is **nothing in the UI** — it's a compile-time switch.

Per-emoji resolution order (both modes):

1. **Self-hosted override** — `wwwroot/emoji-fallback/{codepoint}.png` (for emoji missing or
   outdated in the chosen set, e.g. new Unicode releases). Auto-discovered by a folder scan.
2. **Active set CDN** — Apple (`cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-apple@16.0.0`) **or** Twemoji
   (`cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@latest`), chosen by `ActiveEmojiStyle`.
3. **Twemoji CDN** — final `onerror` fallback for anything the active set is missing (skipped when
   Twemoji is already the source, so Twemoji mode makes no Apple-CDN calls).

> **Why images at all?** We deliberately keep the "swap unicode for an image" model (rather than
> rendering native OS emoji) so every platform sees a consistent design. This was an explicit
> product choice.

## The toggle

Top of `Yap/Services/EmojiService.Rendering.cs`:

```csharp
private enum EmojiStyle { Apple, Twemoji }

// === Switch the active emoji set here (code-only; nothing in the UI). ===
private const EmojiStyle ActiveEmojiStyle = EmojiStyle.Apple;   // flip to EmojiStyle.Twemoji
```

Flip it, rebuild, done. `BuildEmojiImg` reads it to choose the "rest" source; `LocalOverrides` is
checked first regardless, and Twemoji remains the `onerror` last-resort.

## Why this approach (background)

- Apple does **not** distribute its emoji as downloadable image assets — Apple Color Emoji is a
  proprietary OS font. The only way to show Apple art on *non-Apple* devices is to host Apple-style
  PNGs. We use the community `emoji-datasource-apple` image set (Apple-style art) served from jsDelivr.
- Licensing was explicitly ruled out of scope for this project (non-commercial app); that's the
  maintainer's call, not encoded here.
- We considered native-unicode rendering (real Apple emoji only on Apple devices, Twemoji elsewhere)
  but rejected it: it gives up cross-platform consistency. See the planning doc
  `~/.claude/plans/per-apple-guidelines-users-dynamic-metcalfe.md` for the full option analysis.

## Code changes

### `Yap/Services/EmojiService.Rendering.cs` (the active renderer)

A **second partial** of `EmojiService` (the class was already `partial`). It contains the unified
renderer and reuses private helpers from `EmojiService.cs` (`EmojiRegex()`,
`CustomEmojiShortcodeRegex()`, `ShouldMergeEmoji`, `IsEmojiOnlyMessage`, `_customEmojiService`, and
crucially `GetCodePoint()` for the Twemoji codepoint/fallback).

Public methods (active, wired into the UI) and their dormant full-Twemoji backups in `EmojiService.cs`:

| Active method (this file) | Backup twin (EmojiService.cs, untouched) |
|---|---|
| `ConvertEmojis(text, forceSmall, inline, withFallback=true)` | `ConvertEmojisToTwemoji(text, forceSmall, inline)` |
| `RenderMessageContent(text)` | `ProcessMessageContent(text)` |
| `GetEmojiHtml(emoji)` | `GetPickerEmojiHtml(emoji)` |

Key internals:

- **`BuildEmojiImg(emoji, appleCp, …, withFallback)`** — emits the `<img>`. `src` = local override if
  present, else the **active set's** URL (Apple PNG or Twemoji SVG per `ActiveEmojiStyle`); plus an
  `onerror` → Twemoji when `withFallback` and Twemoji isn't already the src.
- **`ResolveAppleCodePoint(emoji)`** — the emoji-datasource filename (no extension); used as the
  **override-file key in both modes** and as the Apple URL. Uses `AppleMap` for bare/legacy/keycap
  emoji; otherwise a direct computation.
- **`NormalizeCodePoints(emoji, keepFe0f)`** — hyphen-joined lowercase hex, each codepoint padded to
  ≥4 digits (`ToString("x4")`), optionally dropping `FE0F`.
- **`AppleMap`** (lazy, from embedded `emoji.json`) — bare (FE0F-stripped) codepoint → fully-qualified
  filename. Only entries whose qualified form contains `FE0F` are stored, so the map is small.
- **`LocalOverrides`** (lazy folder scan of `wwwroot/emoji-fallback/`) — codepoints that have a
  self-hosted PNG.
- **`GetEmojiHtml`** passes `withFallback: false` — the picker's ~1400 cells are all curated emoji
  present in the chosen CDN, so the fallback markup would only bloat them.

> Naming note: set-specific helpers keep the "Apple" name (`AppleImgUrl`, `AppleCdnBase`, `AppleMap`,
> `ResolveAppleCodePoint`) because they refer to the Apple/emoji-datasource set / the override-file
> key even when `ActiveEmojiStyle == Twemoji`.

### `Yap/Data/emoji.json` (embedded resource)

The `emoji-datasource` metadata file (the `unified` codepoints used to build `AppleMap`). Embedded
via `Yap.csproj`:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <None Remove="Data\emoji.json" />
  <EmbeddedResource Include="Data\emoji.json" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Read at runtime with `Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream` (no constructor/DI change needed). It is
**not** web-served (it's inside the DLL).

### `Yap/wwwroot/emoji-fallback/`

Self-hosted Apple PNGs for emoji the chosen set lacks/outdates. Served at `/emoji-fallback/*` by the
existing `app.UseStaticFiles()`. Current contents:

| File | Emoji | Codepoint | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `1faea.png` | 🫪 distorted face | U+1FAEA | Unicode 17 — missing from @16 |
| `1faef.png` | 🫯 fight cloud | U+1FAEF | Unicode 17 — missing from @16 *and* Twemoji |
| `1facd.png` | orca | U+1FACD | Unicode 17 — missing from @16 |
| `1f3f4-200d-2620-fe0f.png` | 🏴‍☠️ pirate flag | ZWJ seq | override @16's older art |

### Wired active (call-site swaps)

The unicode-emoji calls in 6 components point at the active methods (`ConvertEmojis`,
`RenderMessageContent`, `GetEmojiHtml`). **`RenderCustomEmoji` is left alone** — custom `:shortcode:`
emoji are local images, identical under both sets.

Components: `MessageItem.razor`, `EmojiPicker.razor`, `ChatSidebar.razor`, `ChatHeader.razor`,
`UserProfileCard.razor`, `Pages/ChannelSettings.razor`.

### Untouched (full-revert backup)

`Yap/Services/EmojiService.cs` (the original Twemoji methods, caches, `GetCodePoint`) and
`Yap/Services/EmojiData.cs`. No model / migration / settings / DI changes.

## The filename convention (the important detail)

`emoji-datasource` names files by the **fully-qualified `unified` codepoint, lowercased**:
`FE0F` is **kept**, and each codepoint is **zero-padded to ≥4 hex digits**.

| Emoji | emoji-datasource (Apple) file | Twemoji file |
|---|---|---|
| 😀 U+1F600 | `1f600.png` | `1f600.svg` |
| ❤️ U+2764 FE0F | `2764-fe0f.png` | `2764.svg` (FE0F stripped) |
| ©️ U+00A9 FE0F | `00a9-fe0f.png` | `a9.svg` (minimal width) |
| #️⃣ U+0023 FE0F 20E3 | `0023-fe0f-20e3.png` | `23-20e3.svg` |
| 🏳️‍🌈 …FE0F‍🌈 | `1f3f4-fe0f-200d-1f308.png` | same |

Apple naming is the **inverse** of Twemoji's `GetCodePoint` (strips FE0F, minimal width). Because
`EmojiData.cs` stores its picker emoji **bare** (no FE0F), bare legacy/keycap emoji wouldn't match
the qualified Apple filenames — that's exactly what `AppleMap` bridges. Astral emoji, skin-tone
sequences, and FE0F-qualified keyboard input resolve directly without the map. `BuildEmojiImg`
computes both forms (`appleCp` via `ResolveAppleCodePoint`, the Twemoji one via `GetCodePoint`).

URLs:

- Apple CDN: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-apple@16.0.0/img/apple/64/{appleCp}.png`
- Twemoji CDN: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@latest/assets/svg/{twemojiCp}.svg`
- Local: `/emoji-fallback/{appleCp}.png` (override files are named by the **Apple-set** codepoint)

## How to add / fix an emoji (the part you'll come back for)

You'll need this when an emoji renders broken, or a new Unicode set drops and you want the art.

### The foolproof recipe

1. **Find the codepoint the app is looking for.** Send the emoji in the app, open DevTools →
   **Network**. The failing (404) request is `…/img/apple/64/XXXX.png` (Apple mode) — **`XXXX` is
   exactly the name your file must have.** (This sidesteps all the FE0F/padding rules — the app tells
   you the name. The override key is the Apple-set codepoint in both modes.)
2. **Get an Apple PNG** for that emoji (e.g. from [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org) — the page's
   image; its filename usually contains the codepoint too).
3. **Save it as `wwwroot/emoji-fallback/XXXX.png`** (same `XXXX` from step 1).
4. **Restart the app.** The override folder is scanned once at startup. (`UseStaticFiles` serves the
   file at runtime; the scan is what registers it for the lookup — so a restart is required.)

That's it. Local overrides win, so this also **replaces** an emoji whose set art is outdated (e.g. the
pirate flag).

### Naming without DevTools (manual codepoint rules)

Take the emoji's Unicode codepoints (emojipedia lists them under "Codepoints"), lowercase the hex,
drop the `U+`, join multiple with `-`:

- **Single new emoji** (most common): just the hex — `U+1FAEF` → `1faef.png`.
- **Sequences** (ZWJ flags/professions, keycaps): include every codepoint *including* `fe0f` and
  `200d`, in order — 🏴‍☠️ `U+1F3F4 U+200D U+2620 U+FE0F` → `1f3f4-200d-2620-fe0f.png`.
- Pad any codepoint shorter than 4 hex digits to 4 (`U+0023` → `0023`). Astral emoji (U+1Fxxx) are
  already ≥4.

If a file is mis-named it simply won't match (the emoji falls through to the set CDN / Twemoji). When
in doubt, use the DevTools recipe.

### Add it to the picker too (optional)

The fallback renders the emoji wherever it's typed, but it won't appear in the picker drawer until
it's in `EmojiData.cs`. Add the character to the right category's array and an `EmojiKeywords` entry
(use the C# escape `"\U0001FACD"` for brand-new astral glyphs so they can't be mangled in source).
Example: orca was added to the `animals` array after the whale.

### When a newer `emoji-datasource-apple` ships (e.g. v17)

The cleaner long-term fix for "new Unicode set" is to bump the package instead of self-hosting each
emoji:

1. Update the version in **two** places to keep the map and images in sync:
   - `AppleCdnBase` in `Services/EmojiService.Rendering.cs` (the CDN URL).
   - `Yap/Data/emoji.json` — re-download from the matching version:
     `curl -sSL https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-apple@<NEW_VER>/emoji.json -o Yap/Data/emoji.json`
2. Rebuild (the embedded resource is baked at build time).
3. Remove any now-redundant files from `wwwroot/emoji-fallback/` (the CDN now has them). Leftover
   overrides aren't harmful — local always wins — but clean them up to avoid stale art.

### Edge cases

- **Emoji missing from the active set *and* Twemoji** (e.g. fight cloud was 404 on both) → it *must*
  be self-hosted, or it renders broken. There's no other source.
- **Skin-tone variants** of an overridden base aren't covered by a single file — e.g. a local
  `1f483.png` (💃) does not cover `1f483-1f3fd` (💃🏽). Add each variant's file if needed (the CDN
  usually has skin-tone variants already, so this is rare).
- **Picker** uses `GetEmojiHtml` (no Twemoji `onerror`). Its emoji come from the curated
  `EmojiData.cs` set and are all in the chosen CDN, so they never need the fallback.

## Switching the emoji set

- **Apple ⇄ Twemoji (recommended):** flip `ActiveEmojiStyle` in `EmojiService.Rendering.cs` and
  rebuild. Local overrides still apply; in Twemoji mode the rest is Twemoji and no Apple-CDN calls are
  made.
- **Full revert to the original Twemoji path (drops local overrides):** swap the 6 components' call
  sites to the `EmojiService.cs` backups — `ConvertEmojis`→`ConvertEmojisToTwemoji`,
  `RenderMessageContent`→`ProcessMessageContent`, `GetEmojiHtml`→`GetPickerEmojiHtml`. ⚠️ This loses
  the self-hosted overrides, so brand-new emoji (orca/fight-cloud) render broken — prefer the const.

(Grep `ConvertEmojis\b\|RenderMessageContent\|GetEmojiHtml` to find every active call site.)

## Verify after changes

1. `dotnet build` (with `ActiveEmojiStyle = Apple`), run, hard-refresh. Picker shows Apple PNGs;
   Network shows `…emoji-datasource-apple@16.0.0/img/apple/64/*.png` (200). Self-hosted ones
   (🫪 🫯 orca 🏴‍☠️) and legacy/keycap (❤ ☀ © `#️⃣`) render with no 404s.
2. Flip the const to `Twemoji`, rebuild, hard-refresh. Non-override emoji now load
   `…/jdecked/twemoji…/*.svg` (no Apple-CDN requests); the 4 overrides **still** come from
   `/emoji-fallback/`.
3. Force a fallback in Apple mode: an emoji the CDN lacks should swap to a `…/jdecked/twemoji…svg`.
4. Reactions, emoji-only "jumbo" sizing, inline emoji in names, and custom `:shortcode:` emoji all fine.
