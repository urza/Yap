"""Generate the Tea House theme CSS from the extracted artwork's own palette.

Reads  palette.json  (dominant colours + pixel sizes per scene per layer)
Writes ../../Yap/wwwroot/themes/teahouse.css

Why generated: 13 scenes x ~24 variables is 300+ hand-picked hex values that would
all have to stay in step with each other. Instead every colour is derived from one
number per scene - the canvas tile's colour - through two templates, LIGHT and
DARK. That is ~20 tunable offsets in this file rather than 300 hexes in a stylesheet,
and it makes the theme's day arc (warm tan at dawn -> yellow at noon -> cool cyan
in the afternoon -> gold at sunset -> blue at dusk -> neutral at night) carry
through the whole UI on its own.

Which template a scene gets is decided by the WCAG relative luminance of its canvas
colour, because this theme is genuinely light by day and dark by night - see
docs/themes-2.0.md, "Teahouse is not a dark theme". The split lands at 6am and 8pm.

Layer scaling: the header and footer strips are 450-540px and 399-549px tall, so on
any ordinary viewport they overlap and two phases of the same sky meet in a visible
seam. Every layer is therefore scaled by ONE factor, min(1, viewportH / (headerH +
footerH)), expressed in pure CSS as `min(<native>px, <share>svh)` - no JS, and it
re-fits on window resize for free. The factor must be identical across layers or the
teahouse stops meeting the garden's ground line.
